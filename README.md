# ESP32_SoloStorm_Logger
ESP32 connection that will forward teensyport-2.0 telemetry data via bluetooth.  Currently designed to log to SoloStorm app

### This is no longer being developed.  It will work and forward data, however the Arduino IDE library will put the ESP bluetooth into sniff mode when it doesn't receive data, causing interruptions.

### Use the main branch for the ESP-IDF framework which sets the link mode and allows for constant, fast updates.
